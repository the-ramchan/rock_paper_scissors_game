# rock_paper_scissors_game
Created a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors

1. Introduction
I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game utilizing python and the libraries of Numpy, Pandas, and Random.

2. Design and Implementation
•	I designed the game with the following use cases in mind:
    - Able to play as many rounds as the user would like
    - Able to see a recap of all of the rounds
    - Able to start a new game without exiting and restarting the script
                                  
3. Conclusions
Overall, I learned a ton, especially in the utility of functions as I iterated on the development. In my journey on applying the principles learned of ‘not repeating yourself,’ I was able to limit the actual execution code into a handful of lines with a While Loop, while the functions did all of the work and were called upon in the execution.
